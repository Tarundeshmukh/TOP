    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup hot water or as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Step 1
            Mix flours and salt in a large bowl. Use a wooden spoon to stir in water and olive oil. Mix until a soft, elastic dough forms and add more water, if needed. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Step 2
            Divide dough into 10 equal portions, or less if you want larger chapatis. Roll each piece into a ball and let rest for a few minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Step 3
            Heat a lightly greased skillet over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Step 4
            Use a rolling pin to roll dough balls out on a lightly floured surface until very thin, like a tortilla.
        </li>
        <li>
            Step 5
            When the skillet starts to smoke, place a chapati in it. Cook until bottom has brown spots, about 30 seconds, then flip and cook 30 seconds more. Repeat to cook remaining chapatis.
        </li>
    </ol>
